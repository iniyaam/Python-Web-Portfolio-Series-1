# Welcome to Comedy Central!
This website is where you can learn about all things comedy. We have everything from knock knock jokes, programming jokes, a featured joke, comedians and comedy through the decades, and the history of comedy!

## How To Run:
Press Run and click on IP address link given from INTELLIJ. You will be directed to the Home page, which will have welcome message. Use the menu to be redirected to other pages If you add /playground into the URL, you can find the secret joke :) Additionally, the home page has a button which will take you to the Flask Web Portfolio, which has links to all of our journals and projects. In the Web Portolio there are links to our project plans and code for the Hello Series Project and the Flask Series Project. There is also a link to our study journals as well. 

## Purpose of The Project
This project helped us to learn about the HTML language and some CSS. In this project, both Python and HTML are used, and we used the Python Fundamentals to code this website using Flask.

## File Descriptions
main.py: is in python, imports the html files. Has routes for each page and URL.

base.html: base for website, the back end which connects all the components
